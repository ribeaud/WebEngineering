  ## The Internet
]
.right-column[
The **Internet** is an enormous global network of billions of servers, computers, and other hardware devices. It is _decentralised_.

- We need an IP address and some protocols (TCP, email, HTTP, ...)

  ## The Web
]
.right-column[
  The **World Wide Web (WWW)**, or simply **Web**, is a way of accessing information over the medium of the **Internet**.
- WWW = HTML.red[*] + HTTP(S)

The **Web** is a _portion_ of the **Internet**.

.footnote[.red[*] including CSS, JavaScript, and other browser enabled contents]
]
???
- WWW created in 1989-91 by Tim Berners-Lee
- We have a standard and we can link to other pages
- Browsers (the first browser designed by Tim Berners-Lee - https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb.html)

  ## HTML
]
.right-column[
**HyperText Markup Language**: used for writing web pages. It describes the **content** and **structure** of _information_ on a Web page.
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the `<html>` tag.
The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is not an **HTML** tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of **HTML** the page is written in.
- Element: `<tag>content</tag>`. Example: `<p>This is a paragraph</p>`.
  - _Empty_ element: can be opened and closed in one tag. Example: `<img src="bunny.jpg" alt="bunny" />` (`<img ...></img>` NOT allowed).
- Attribute: `<tag name="value">`. Example: `<a href="page2.html">Next page</a>`.
- [Entities](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp): `&copy;`, `&#169;` for **Â©**
]
???
- Not the same as the **presentation** (appearance on screen)
- Most whitespace is insignificant in HTML (ignored or collapsed to a single space).
  What could you use to enforce a space?
- Current version is **HTML 5**. This is the one we are going to use.
- **HTML** is part of a bigger family **SGML** (Standard Generalised Markup Language), like **XML** (Extensible Markup Language)
