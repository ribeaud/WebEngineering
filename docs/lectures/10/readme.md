  ## Overview
]
.right-column[
- **Single-person** activity
- _Bring-your-own_ idea or any of https://flaviocopes.com/sample-app-ideas/. Think about _10mn_ on a **disturbing factor**.
- Idea implementation/realisation should take around 4 \* 6h = **24h** in total.
- Delivery format: **Grails** application in [GitHub](https://www.github.com/). You might take any profile of the ones listed [here](https://grails.org/profiles.html). _Web_ profile is the default and preferred one.

### Support

1. Spend _20mn_ on a problem. If you do NOT solve it, go to next point.
1. Try to solve the problem with a colleague. Spend _20mn_ together on that problem. If you do NOT solve it, go to next point.
1. Get in touch with me: tag me (@ribeaud) on **GitHub** in a comment. If I do NOT respond in the next 2-3 days, remind me via email. During that time, work on a different part of your project. Do NOT loose time!
