# Team Staffing

A possible project idea: manage which developer works on which project.

## Possible Workflow

- CRUD Projects and Developers
- Assign Developers to Projects
- Show where Developers are over- or undercommitted
- Show where Projects or over- or understaffed

## Constraints

The systems shows a snapshot in time, i.e. the _current_
project staffing.

## Possible Extensions

- Security setup such that only certain authorities can change project assignments
- Introducing time such that project staffing is per calendar week
- Interactive assignment (e.g. drag and drop)
- Automatic assignment of Developers to Projects in order to optimize
