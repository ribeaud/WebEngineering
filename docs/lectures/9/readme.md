.right-column[
- **Single-person** activity
- _Bring-your-own_ idea or any of https://flaviocopes.com/sample-app-ideas/. Think _10mn_ alone about a **disturbing factor**. Idea implementation/realisation should take around 4 * 6h = **24h** in total.
- Delivery format: **Grails** application in [GitHub](https://www.github.com/). You might take any profile of the ones listed [here](https://grails.org/profiles.html). _Web_ profile is the default and preferred one.

### Support

1. Try to solve the problem with a colleague. Spend 20mn together on that problem.
1. Get in touch with me: tag me (@ribeaud) on **GitHub**.
